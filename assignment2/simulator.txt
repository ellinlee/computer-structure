The simulator follows those below steps:
    1. Exponent Alignment Module: 
        Matches the exponents of both numbers before addition
        Shifts the mantissa right while increasing the exponent of the smaller number until both exponents match

    2. Mantissa Addition Module: 
        Performs 4-bit binary addition after exponent alignment
        Processes addition bit by bit, considering carry propagation

    3. Overflow and Normalization Module:
        When the result exceeds 4 bits, shifts mantissa right and increases exponent
        Ensures proper normalization of the result according to floating-point standards

    4. Result Storage Module:
        Stores the final normalized mantissa and exponent
        Makes the result available for further operations or use
