# Movement Detection & Floating-Point Addition (RISC-V & MIPS Assembly)  

## üìö About  
This repository contains two assembly programs I wrote while studying **Computer Structure**.  
The programs demonstrate fundamental concepts in **movement detection** and **floating-point addition** using RISC-V and MIPS assembly languages, respectively.

## üíª Programs  

### 1. Movement Detection Program (RISC-V)  
A program to detect movement by analyzing brightness changes between three consecutive frames.  
- **How it works:** Compares brightness differences across frames against a threshold (0.1).  
- **Output:**  
  - "Movement detected" if the change exceeds the threshold.  
  - "No movement detected" if not.  

### 2. Floating-Point Addition Simulator (MIPS)  
A program that simulates floating-point addition using integer arithmetic.  
- **How it works:**  
  - Aligns exponents, adds mantissas, checks for overflow, and normalizes the result.  
- **Output:** The normalized floating-point result stored in memory.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run  
1. Use a RISC-V simulator (e.g., Spike, RARS) for the movement detection program.  
2. Use a MIPS simulator (e.g., SPIM, QtSPIM) for the floating-point addition program.  
3. Load the appropriate assembly file and run it.
